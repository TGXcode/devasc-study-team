<p>I have learned that Git is an open source and popular code version control suite. It can be used to facilitate and monitor the evolution of a code repository. Git allows you to make branches of code, then merge them back into one track. This makes it very easy to organize new feature development. </p>

<p>GitHub is an online repository for Git made by Microsoft. By using a personal API access token with your account, you can easily transfer git push/pull/merge requests between GitHub and the Linux terminal. GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with others and discover thousands of public coding projects.</p>
